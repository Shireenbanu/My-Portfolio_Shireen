### Shireen's Portfolio (or as I like to call it, my bragging wall)
Hello there, internet stranger! I'm Shireen, a software developer with a knack for coding and a love for PostgreSQL. This portfolio is where I showcase my coding wizardry and humblebrag about my awesome projects.

About Me
I'm like a superhero, but instead of saving the world, I save failed code. And instead of a cape, I wear a hoodie. My superpower? Debugging, of course!

Skills
Ruby on Rails (master)
PostgreSQL (sensei)
Design patterns (ninja)
Code debugging (Sherlock Holmes)
